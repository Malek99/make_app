# make_app

The purpose of this program is to make it easier to add an executable file to the list of applications of a GNU/Linux operating system, simply, it makes a .desktop file and puts it in /usr/share/applications directory, by specifying the executable file and the desired icon for it, then prompting the user to enter the name of the application to be shown in the list, prompting the user if he/she wants to add a comment, and finally asking him/her if the program is a terminal application or not.

The blank .desktop file generated by this program is as follows:
# begin
[Desktop Entry]

Type=Application

Encoding=UTF-8

Name=

Comment=

Exec=

Icon=

Terminal=
# end

To use this program download the file make_app.c and do the following:

1- change the directory to the folder where you downloaded it, for example:

    cd Downloads/

2- compile the program:

    gcc make_app.c -o make_app

3- you will see a new executable file called make_app, copy it to /usr/local/bin so you can use it whenever you want:

    sudo cp make_app /usr/local/bin
   
4- now go to the directory of the executable file that you want to add to your applications list and do this:

    sudo make_app <Executable file> <Icon>
  
   replace the placeholders by the path to your executable and the icon to be shown in your applications list, you can replace <Icon> with "null" if you don't want to use an icon

5- it will ask you about the name of the application, this name will be shown in the list of your applications and it well be used as the name of the .desktop file

6- next, you should state if you want to add a comment, this comment usually is shown in the tooltip or under the name of the application

7- it will ask you if the program is a terminal application, usually the answer is no.
